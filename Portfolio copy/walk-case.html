        <p>Holidays are always great fun. Until you have spent the better part two hours trying to find a certain historical landmark that you just have to see in person. Thats where walk comes in. Walk is essential the tour guide in your pocket you never knew you needed. it essentially works as a facebook for landmarks, restaurants, bars and other niche locations.</p>

    <h2>What is Walk?</h2>
    <p>WALK is your pocket sized guide to any major sized city you happen to be in. With WALK installed on your phone, you will be able to access a large library of landmarks, restaurants, bars, art installations and much more. When you have selected a destination, you will have the option to get immediate directions to that place; as well as information about the location such as: is it child friendly; can you get food at this place; opening and closing hours. WALK also has a feature that allows for the app to send you notifications whenever you are near any points of interest that you may want to explore.</p>

    <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>For this project, I started by researching other travel apps with similar features as my own. I wanted to see how they had laid out their interfaces and how the overall user experience felt. I was also looking at the overall aesthetics of the apps. After this I started sketching out some wireframe layouts for the app. When I was done with this I started into creating the app and all its assets on a mixture of Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD.
